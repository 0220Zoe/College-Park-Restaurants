V000000001,Maddie S.,11/7/21,"Our server was pleasant and the restaurant was cool, however, we waited far too long for food.  The restaurant was not packed full, but the kitchen was backed up to the point where it took over an hour for us to get our meal.  Then when it arrived, the food was over cooked and simultaneously cold, as if it was sitting in the window waiting for who knows how long after how long it took to even get it on a plate.  No one at the table even ordered anything that should have taken that long to make, nor would be a challenge to get out to the table.  My avocado toast was soggy and cold, with luke warm and boiled through ""poached eggs.""  Same with two others at the table.  I try to be patient but have worked in the restaurant industry for years, it should AT LEAST have been obvious to someone in the kitchen that the amount of time the eggs were cooked would overcook and ruin them.  Easy fix yet the food still came out like that, bummer.",2,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000002,Abby W.,11/5/21,"I love this place. Great drinks, great food, and fantastic service. My bartender Nikki was extremely attentive and her drinks tasted literally amazing. Back to the food. So amazing and yummy you can tell that the food is baked fresh; nothing frozen. The only thing that I'm really torn up about is that the wings got taken off the menu. The triple cooked chicken wings were the only things that got me through dark times. I really hope that they will be brought back. Please, if you are in charge of the menu and you are seeing this, bring these back. I'll be forever grateful.",5,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000003,Amanda S.,11/4/21,Had a great experience! Great food and great service on Sunday for Halloween. My bartender's name was M.P. I think and she was great!,5,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000004,Diane T.,11/4/21,"OMG!  What an incredible find in College Park!!  We went there before a basketball game--our first time and definitely not our last.  The pizza was SENSATIONAL!  Homemade think crust--so tasty.  We ordered the BBQ chicken, which had a wonderfully rich BBQ sauce and a lot of chicken.  We also got the Carnivore--and the meats were so flavorful.  

The manager stopped by and answered questions.  He was doing an outstanding job with the staff--giving them highlights of the menu and then the chef brought out each dish for the staff to try so they could describe it better.  ALL of the foods looked so delicious.  The manager sent out a complimentary cauliflower Rueben to try--even my husband who hates cauliflower loved it!  Very creative menu!  I noticed the staff kept going back to the blackened chicken mac and cheese, over and over.  Next trip!

There is a HUGE outdoor space, but the inside area has incredibly tall ceilings.  Feels very spacious.  Fabulous food, great service.  I look forward to eating our way through the entire menu!

The place is easy to find--it's the big grey building behind The Hotel, across from the University of Maryland campus, on Hotel Street, off Route 1.",5,Yelp,P,R100000

V000000006,Gabrielle B.,10/20/21,"I've only been here a few times but each time I've gone it has been a bad experience. The food is overpriced and honestly pretty bad. I got the handmade soft pretzel and it was like an unseasoned bread stick. The fried chicken sandwich on the donut was horrible as well, dry chicken and dry donut. Their brunch food seemed to be decent but the service when I went was horrid. No one came to take our order for over 20 minutes and my friend was served the wrong drink but no one came once everything was delivered until it was time to get the check so she couldn't even get her drink changed. I do not recommend this place at all.",2,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000007,Frank C.,10/17/21,"My 5 friends and I went there for one of my friends birthdays and had the worst service I have every had in my entire life. The first sign was when I said my Sierra Mist tasted like seltzer and she asked me to try my other friends Pepsi to see if that one tasted similar. Secondly, after taking our appetizer orders she waited 45 minutes to even ask if we wanted something for dinner. There was a band playing and we could visibly see her dancing with her friends while ignoring us at the table. Then as we are eating she asked if we could pay early so that she could leave. Unknowing what to do, she took our card immediately and made us pay while we had gotten our meals 15 minutes beforehand. When my friend payed for the dinner herself she gave me a dirty look as if I did something wrong. The fact that we spent over $150 and she asked if we could do her a favor and pay early so that she could leave is absolutely disgraceful. I'm not sure how she has a job serving people when she can't even be nice to them. So she left, leaving us with no way to order dessert, no way to refill drinks, and no way to get boxes to bring food home. We didn't even get a chance to get the birthday girl a cake before our service was cut. We went to the manager to say something because the service was so terrible and while we were doing that she walked up to the conversation and said ""oh is it about me?'. The worst part is that all the manager did was say that he's sorry and she should have been more attentive. Then again in the parking lot she got into a verbal altercation with me, the paying customer. Absolutely disgusting. I do not recommend this place at all, the atmosphere is nice, food is okay, but the service is so bad I wouldn't even bother giving it a try.",1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000008,Adina M.,10/16/21,"This place has so much potential. First they should better the service because we waited a while for our food and no one came to check on us. Second we ordered the pretzels which were way too greasy, it was dripping all over me. The Avocado toast Benedict was not proportioned well. The tomato slices were way too large, the toast was too burnt, the flavor just wasn't good. I was very underwhelmed here. I do not need to return. It gets 2 stars because it was very cute and the security guard was very nice.",2,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000009,Eleni H.,10/11/21,"This is my first review on yelp. The vibe and the place is nice to just sit and talk. But the food was soooo bad, I had to return the birria Raman. The mozzarella stick was burnt and it didn't have cheese at all. It's just not it. When I got to my car I threw up.",1,Yelp,N,R100000

Lori D.",10/11/21,"Won't be back.

Had a 11:45a reservation and was seated immediately. Our server checked in quickly and took our drink orders. So far, so good. That's where the good ended.

When the server brought our drinks, he had handled them at the rim and spilled quite a bit. It was quite the mess. Unfortunately, because our server rarely checked on us, we had to get up to get our own napkins to clean up.

We waited for over an hour for our food and when we got our food, it was cold and hard (toast was almost inedible).

For the price point, it was not worth it. Great ambience and venue. Horrible service.",1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000011,Nora B.,10/9/21,"Solid brunch options, spacious (both interior and exterior seating), and attentive servers. I got the Monte Cristi burrito which is a bit burned but tasted ok. The portion is quite big so I couldn't finish, but it's fair for the price. Still, it's a nice place for brunch + cocktails with friends near College Par",3,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000012,Rick B.,10/8/21,"This place is chronically understaffed and disorganized. Tonight I was told the wait for a table would be 35 minutes; I waited at the bar and an hour later still hadn't gotten they promised text. Meantime I paid for 2 hours on the meter. I went back to the hostess stand, was ignored, until finally I walked in front of the people in line and asked what was up. Hostess said, oh, sorry, a lot of people reserved tables but they are bussing three now. That was 15 minutes ago.",1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000013,Tracy H.,9/26/21,"A welcomed ""trendy"" restaurant/bar in College Park, near the University of Maryland campus, I had dinner here twice last week with a friend -- once on a Monday night, and then on a Saturday night.  The bartenders and servers were friendly, attentive, and excellent.  The cocktails were especially well made with care, the food was hot and well presented.  During the pandemic, I have generally dined outdoors, but I was comfortable staying inside as the space here was relatively large and open.  A couple of minor awkward/negative points:  security checks ID at the door to put a paper bracelet on your wrist if you will be drinking; and, during both visits, security walked around about 10 minutes before closing to ask us and others to wrap up.  Monday night was quieter and better for having a conversation, which I preferred; Saturday night had louder ""background"" music, requiring louder talking.  I toggled between 3 and 4 stars, even after some adverse effects from one of the dinners, but the stellar service, drinks, and pizza pushed me to 4 stars.

Below are some notes on the specific items I ordered during my two visits:

Schmidt Happens (5/5 stars):  I watched the bartender carefully make this cocktail, with the different color of gins layered for a nice presentation.  I recently discovered that I like gin, and this drink did not disappoint.  For me, this cocktail was one that I could sip throughout dinner.  It seemed appropriately gin-strong with just a hint of sweetness.  I am not always in a gin mood, but when I am, this would be a good go-to.

Figgy Smalls (4/5 stars):  I ordered this cocktail since I like both Hennessy and especially Grand Marnier.  This drink was nicely presented with a sugar rim and sage leaf floating on top.  As expected, it was a bit on the sweet side but not overly so.  Because it was so smooth, and because it was small, I could have simply downed it and moved on.  I forced myself to make it last through half the dinner before then ordering a beer that I was curious about.

Aslin Tease Me Big A$$ Stout 13% ABV (5/5 stars):  I first asked for a taste, and the server gave me a generously sized sample.  A very dark, very smooth, very strong, slightly sweet stout.  My kind of sipping beer!  

Buffalo Chicken Pizza (4/5 stars):  This pizza came out piping hot!  It had a nice mix of chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce with a comfortable amount of heat.  The crust was thin and crispy.  I had planned to have only 1-2 slices and take the rest home, but I instead ate 4 of the 6 slices.

Alfredo's Chicken Medallions (2/5 stars):  Normally, I would like the combination of components with fettuccine -- spinach, pancetta, smoked mozzarella, cream.  And, my friend who had it on the first visit raved about it.  So, let me start with the positive for my dish, which I ordered on the second visit -- This pasta came out hot and steaming.  Now for the negatives.  The cream sauce was not as rich and thick as I would have expected; it was somewhat light and thin.  The fettuccine was overcooked, the chicken overcooked and dry.  Overall, something was ""off"" on the taste; I couldn't quite place it.  I chalked it up to the combination just not being what I expected.  It was ""OK"", I was hungry, and so I finished it.  Shortly after finishing dessert, the upset stomach began, with other related symptoms following until mid morning.  I probably will steer clear of this dish on future visits.

Blondie with Ice Cream (3/5 stars):  Not a strong stand out but fine for when you want to satisfy that sweet tooth.  The blondie itself was bigger than I anticipate; more ice cream would have been ideal.  The addition of chocolate and marshmallow cream was nice, and the blueberries were unexpected and went well with the blondie and ice cream.

V000000014,Chelsea M.,9/25/21,"I've never been compelled to leave a review but the Hall CP is a very interesting place. Inarguably, the Hall has the best food in college park compared to restaurants of a similar nature. Like if you're choosing between the Hall and Looney's, I promise your palette will have a much better experience at the Hall than the restaurant whose food tastes like the floor of a 7-11 over seasoned with old bay. Although I think the Hall is confused on what they think Jerk chicken is, the rest of the food is really good. I recommend the the soft pretzels. It tastes how lil nas x's Call Me By Your Name sounds. I also love the lavender lemonade! I'd pass on their frozen drinks but that's just my personal preference. Most of my critique of the Hall lies in the service. When my husband and I first went it took us 15 minutes to get served and that's only because we flagged someone down. We also received our appetizers and main entree all at once on both occasions we dined at the Hall. It feels like staff is really hesitant to serve like they're unsure of what to do. There doesn't seem to be a dress code for waiters which is fine except I had no idea who was a waiter and who wasn't. One girl was dressed like she flew back from New York Fashion week and another that looked like they just got back from the gym. Maybe a name tag or uniformed fanny packs would be helpful? There was one girl who I did see with a fanny pack and sneakers and looked like a real professional. I watched her serve her customers with envy. Other than that, the restaurant was really cute! Great spot to hang out after a game or for happy hour or something.",4,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000015,Aimeer M.,9/24/21,"Horrible service. I arrived with 1 more person & the 2 young white hostess stated it was full. However a group of 5 young girls walked in after us , with no reservation & got seated.... Deduce whatever you want from that.",1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000016,Dinh D.,9/17/21,"Been here several times and normally the service is decent. Last night 9/16 around 7:50pm, my friends and I sat at the bar due to reservations only after a certain time. The female bartender with dark hair just put the paper menu down and did not even introduce herself or welcome us. After a couple minutes just asked for what we wanted. My friends and I are pretty easy going diners so we know what we want after having visiting this place several times. Our drinks and food were forgotten and and we had to notify the staff of them missing. We were never checked on often and had to wave them down for service. At the end, my friends and I asked to split the bill and the bartender gave an attitude and rudely walked off from my friend while he was trying to explain what he had ordered which was pretty simple since he only had drinks. I've been here several times as I am a alumni to the school and this place has pretty good food and drink prices. I have had decent service with some being great however, this was the worst one.",2,Yelp,N,R100000

V000000020,Tshegofatso T.,9/14/21,Asked for medium done burger and I got a burnt burger with sloppy service. The servers here are kids and they do not take their job seriously. They come in looking dirty and saggy. I've been here a couple of times and every time there is something wrong. I will no longer come here. The only good thing here is their pizza and nachos.,2,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000021,Morgan J.,9/13/21,I love this place. The waitresses were very kind and worked with us for a table so we could have our best experience in the pandemic. The flavors of this restaurant are great and I love the young atmosphere since it is right near the University,5,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000022,Mahin Z.,9/12/21,"The menu was really fun!  They remained in touch with modern influences (such as tiktok trends) while also maintaining good options on the menu.

V000000023,Jamie A.,9/11/21,"The food wasn't bad...the service was though. After being seated it had to take at least 30 minutes to get water. The things is, it wasn't even our waitress who attended to us. Instead another young lady who was about to clock out noticed we'd been unattended to for some time and told us she felt bad to see us wait. We were also given brunch menus when we arrived which was right when brunch was ending. We only found out after an hour of waiting for our actual server to come by. She took our drink order and then left for another long period of time. Overall she wasn't attentive to our table and left us waiting with very little service. But when we did get our food (short rib tacos and shrimp nachos) we enjoyed everything. The drinks were also pretty good. Unfortunately our service was very slow, not to mention the numerous BEES that swarmed us. We had to get up and move seats about 3 times to avoid them. At the end of our meal our waitress walk by us without checking in about 3 separate times, and again it was another waitress who got her attention for us so we could pay. We enjoyed the food but wish service wasn't so disappointing.",2,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000024,Aaron P.,9/11/21,"Solid brunch destination. Great food, great prices, enjoyed the mimosas, and the DJ's music selection. Everything about this place was great except one thing - BEES. We were seated on the outside near the building and as soon as our food came out the bees were attacking in force. We would have moved, but we were told no other tables with umbrellas (as 3 such tables sat empty) were available. We had to finish our meal and leave quickly before the swarm took over. I'd love to come back. Hopefully the bee problem is fixed by then.",4,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000025,Alyssa S.,9/11/21,"I've been coming to the hall since it opened and for the first time since then I've been treated poorly. I walked into the establishment as I would have any other time and told the hostess that I was meeting friends at the bar. After an hour and a half of sitting at the bar a bouncer, who they have never had before, decided to come up to me and rudely say ""where is your wristband."" With absolutely no idea what he was talking about I looked at him and he said ""did someone card you."" Of course someone carded me I'm 21 ordering alcohol. But instead he insisted on staring and BENDING my real id only for it to be real. He then brought over the manager while they both interrogated me about what happened.

V000000027,Ariel B.,9/6/21,Whew rough spot! Was so excited to try The Hall and while the brews didn't let me down the food did! I ordered the crab dip & the Chesapeake pizza and THEY BOTH WERE MISSING THE CRAB!! I was heartbroken! Service was slow too we had a nice lady from behind the bar serving us as she took care of the bar patrons as well and it took so long to get her attention that I forgot to mention the lack of crab. Decent spot just don't expect crab.,3,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000028,Mary N.,9/5/21,This place just hired 3rd party security for checking ids. I am 21 years old and they told me my id was fake and forced me to leave the restaurant. All of my friends who are also 21 were let in except for me. I strongly believe that I was denied because I am gay woman. I will never be spending my money here again.,1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000029,Delanie V.,9/4/21,The food here is really good but it has some of the worst service ever... the last few times I've been here it consistently takes 20+ minutes to just get water. Like this place a lot but don't know if I'll come back due to the horrendous service.,1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000030,Scott A.,9/4/21,"My longtime dining partner and I both grew up in a college town. So, on a whim, (and a vacation day) we decided to wander over to College Park MD.

We stopped at the Hall CP for Lunch.

1. their chicken wings were amazing! the right mix of crunchy and tasty. The ranch dip was perfect!
2. The food overall was a mix of brunch and lunch which was nice. My dining partner went for brunch and enjoyed eggs with Ricotta Cheese. For those who know her, something Greek is not a surprise!
3. I got the Lamb Wrap, The Hall's take on a Gyro. The meat was ground lamb, well prepared and spiced! The pita was awesome!

Oh yeah, did I mention they had me at Guinness on tap?

We ate outdoors and it was the perfect day. Our server was very friendly and checked in on us often!

The Hall CP, a great place to stop in College Park!",5,Google,P,R100000
V000000031,Pg E.,8/30/21,"Where to begin...

My friend arrived before me and was told there wouldn't be a 45 minute wait, I then mentioned that we had a reservation and they sat us immediately. The host was walking so fast that she was already coming back inside when we were coming out...strike 1.

We asked to move tables to the shade since a table opened up, the server said it would be fine to let our server know. We informed him that we didn't have one, yet. We sat and sat and sat after 30 mins I stopped a young lady who was serving many of the people outside. I asked if we could get a server, some water something. She said ""sure""
...20 minutes nothing
I see her again and ask where our server is...she replies "" we are doing a shift change, sorry for the delay, but your server will be here soon.""
...10 minutes...nothing
I flag her again and ask for the manager.
The manager comes out and blames me and my friend for the absent server, she goes back and forth with me about the mix up but still blames us.

I'm sorry but we asked before we moved!!

She offers drinks on the house (She covered one round)

A lovely server comes out named MP who was very attentive and apologetic (ask for MP !!). I suspect she's their best server and they wanted her to help smoothe things over ...

Our food was bland and terrible, giant mozzarella sticks needed some flavor in that breading, some salt, pepper, onion or garlic powder ....SOMETHING.

Old bay honey Wings fried 3 times, please stop at 2 ( and I love my wings fried hard.... but baby not this hard) were bland..

Brussel sprouts .... oily but had seasoning

I wouldn't come here again... like not even for a free soda.",1,Yelp,N,R100000
V000000032,Stacey M.,8/29/21,"I just went to The Hall after my daughter had been raving about this place. What a let down. The food was mediocre. They ran out of my original choice, the short rib tacos. How does a restaurant run out of food? On top of that the waitress was terrible. We were placed in the back room. The waitress kept peeking around the corner multiple times before she finally came to our table. She never checked in after our order was placed. Or after the food was brought to our table. I don't want to embarrass her by publicly naming her on this platform. Management, let this be a notice to you that you should better train your employees on how to treat customers. In this day and age consumers have many food options. We don't have to make The Hall one of them.",1,Yelp,N,R100000

We had a 17 yr old with us, so being able to also spend time with him was great, since we can't take him most places past 8. service was on point and everyone was courteous!

There was zero wait here and there is plenty of seating in several different areas, and outdoor seating as well.

We both had cocktails which were delicious
-bottomless mimosa for me (several flavors available, I tried 2 that were both great)
-wake 'n bake coffee cocktail for her

She had an eggs benedict and I had the monte cristo burrito. Both were great.

Everything was delicious and affordable, would definitely come back!

If you are unfamiliar with the campus:
The parking situation is confusing, and our google maps gps sent us to the completely wrong area/missed the turn completely, so we both had to circle back to the main road and u-turn to get into the entrance.
The parking lot is one big area which seems to have some paid parking and possibly some that isn't? some spots were clearly labeled as not for public parking, but others were not. It seemed like part of the lot near the building was free to park, but the spots next to it were pay via app/machine. We both think we found okay spots and were not towed thankfully, so possibly free on weekends.",5,Yelp,P,R100000

I got the ""bacon, ham, and pineapple jam"" pizza, forgot what they call it on the menu but it was pretty damn good. The jam was a little too sweet but it wasn't a big enough deal to warrant less stars. Their pizzas are 12"" with six slices. I was happy to find a place away from home that can serve me pizza while accommodating my food allergies, as their pizza dough is made in-house and was assured that my entree did not contain my allergen. The waitress was very helpful with drink recommendations and the overall service was relatively quick. If I was local, I'd definitely try out their brunch. It was a very enjoyable place to catch up with some friends and I'd definitely come during happy hour again.",5,Yelp,P,R100000

V000000038,Garid G.,8/9/21,"Great, cheap brunch spot that hits the spot!

Went here almost on a whim on Sunday because we wanted brunch. We made a reservation via OpenTable but probably didn't need to. It wasn't too crowded but there were plenty of customers as well. Service was great regardless. Our waiter came by multiple times during our meal always with a smile on his face and willing to provide whatever we needed.

The food was also very good. We wanted to order the omelet but asked for very specific things to be taken out and other things to be added and they almost got the order perfectly right besides one small ingredient. The pancakes meal was very good. The bacon may have been the best part.

Sunday's are half off drinks. I ordered a wonderful sangria that definitely hit the spot and I would order again. There are also other drinks that I'm sure are just as good.

We are definitely looking forward to going back and trying something different next time as we feel lie we only touched one aspect of the menu.

Would like to see what it is like when the student's come back to campus as I imagine things will be much busier and a little different.",5,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000039,S N.,8/5/21,"Really great! Kinda overpriced for the college crowd, but overall the flavor and quality of the food makes it worth it.

V000000040,Vivian C.,8/3/21,"The Hall CP was good! The drinks were tasty and strong!  The food was amazing. From the appetizers to the food (brunch). The menu has food for all eaters (vegan, gluten, vegetarian). You will get your money's worth. We dined inside due to the weather. Hopefully next time we can enjoy the cool modern outdoor space.

The only thing that made my girls and I uncomfortable were the metal dining chairs (not heavy bottom/plus sized approved). We asked to sit at the cushioned booth (much better).

Undecided where we would go for dinner at 8:30pm on a Sun night, and realized this cute place called The Hall right behind the hotel. Food was AMAZING, particularly the short rib tacos, the appetizer wings, and the BEST Chicken Alfredo EVER( (the crispy pancetta in the Alfredo gave it an amazing taste). Our waitress, KC, was so wonderful!! She was very attentive and super sweet!! Highly recommend this place (and The Hotel!) if you're ever in town! Definitely coming back!",5,Yelp,P,R100000

I got the street cauliflower which I highly recommend as an appetizer, and the chicken pow salad for my entree. Both were pretty decent. We also got a twisted tea drink but the drinks are a little overpriced ($12). The waitress was very friendly but sometimes it can take them a while to get to you for the check.

V000000045,Jennifer J.,7/21/21,"Food here is pretty good, but unfortunately we got bad service when we dined in a few weeks ago.

The Good - Initially we've ordered from here a few times via UberEats and enjoyed the food. We live nearby, so we were excited to dine-in the establishment. Park in the allocated spots for The Hall. The restaurant is nice, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Liked how everything is laid out and decorated. Definitely a vibe for the uni students. Food staples - soft pretzels w/ cheese fondue, nachos, fried chicken sandwich and pizzas.

The Bad - Our server ended up being one of the bartenders, and he needs to stay behind the bar. I was a bit indecisive on what to order and he seemed annoyed, which doesn't make a patron feel good. Alas, we did order and although our appetizer came out at a decent time, we waited for about an hour for our entrees to arrive. It wasn't excessively busy and the restaurant was nearly empty by the time we received our food. Our server was behind the bar majority of the time and by the late time he noticed, he went and checked on our food. One of the cooks brought our food out, and she was apologetic.

The Ugly - The service from our server/bartender sucked, so docking two stars. The dine-in experience had its aftereffect - we used to order a lot from here and we haven't ordered since...or cared to dine-in. Oi",3,Yelp,N,R100000

With a fairly limited menu,  which has some very interesting flavor profiles, all effort is wasted because the kitchen can't move the plates.  A 100 minute wait for eggs benedict, a tuna burger, an acai bowl, and buffalo chicken tacos is unacceptable.  Of course the waitress apologized, but didnt think to refresh our drinks until the second apology tour.  When the food did arrive, it came in shifts and some of our plates were cold.  How is that even possible?  If you want to wait,  the food is fairly good,  but make sure you pay enough for parking.",2,Yelp,N,R100000

Honestly I thought it was going to be a lot especially with the donut bun, but it was actually pretty well balanced. The chicken was juicy and a huge serving. It came with this sweet, spicy sauce and it really helped the whole sandwich. The greens had some bitterness which really helped with the sweetness. My dragonfruit beer was pretty good - not too sweet, not too bitter. (I will say, towards the end of my drink I saw an eyelash in it. Ended up not finishing it, but other than that it was good.

Although newer to the restaurant he was VERY knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions with great detail. He consistently came to check on the quality of each item that hit the table. As a former server/bartender myself I greatly appreciated that. The drinks (Long Island and Electric Lemonade Crush) were made to perfection.

V000000055,Marcques W.,7/8/21,"The wife and I came to The Hall for an impromptu Day Date with drinks and apps. This was our first time here for passing by many times per week.
Upon arriving, we waited a couple of minutes for a table and to be seated. I'm not sure the reason because it wasn't busy and there was more than enough seating inside and outside. Our intentions were to sit outside, but we weren't sure if the rain would start dinner or later.
We were walked to what would be or table, which was a high two-seater with bar stools. Lol Nah, not with, as I already mentioned, numerous, normal height tables and chairs around. We opted to sit outside.
We ordered a couple of Figgy Smalls, Pickle Brined Chicken Tenders, Brussel Sprouts with hot honey and liquid feta, Triple Fried Wings with honey butter and old bay, and a literal Bag of Fries.
No sooner than receiving the Brussels sprouts, it started to rain. We asked to be seated inside, and for some strange reason we were tried to be given the high two-seater table and chairs again! We asked to be sat at another table by the garage doors that were closed.
The food came out and we observed how the restaurant was setup like it would be poppin' on the weekend or after work. Post-Covid of course.  
The Figgy Smalls were good. They tasted like something I've inadvertently made at home while experimenting.  The chicken tenders were really good. I really liked the honey mustard sauce. It brought out the dill flavor.  The Brussel Sprouts were really good. I liked the mix of sweet and little heat. My wife are the wings, which she said were good. Lol The bag of fries were a lot. About four or five people could have eaten from that bag.
Will definitely be back. By the time we left, the restaurant picked up filled up quite quickly. Shout-out to our waitress who was nice. I forget her name.",4,Google,P,R100000

V000000057,Cameron B.,7/2/21,"Great new spot in College Park!

After hearing several good things about this place from friends and fellow Yelpers I decided to check it out myself.

I met two friends here around 6pm for a Friday afternoon happy hour.  Upon walking in, I knew I would like the place.  The building is very open with a good array of tables, bar stool seating, and booths.  It's decorated very vibrantly with murals and custom art pieces.  It gives a bit of an industrial vibe that I enjoy.  There was a mix of age demographics - from the current college students, to families, to working professionals.  Everyone seemed comfortable.

We put our name in for a table and took a seat at the bar for a drink while we waited.  I had a whiskey ginger which was $5 for happy hour. My friends both ordered mules for $9 which were not on the HH menu.  Other happy hour discounts included $1-2 off of select beers and $2-3 off wines. There's no food included in the happy hour deals.

At the bar, the staff was a bit slower than I'm accustomed to from other bars.  The restaurant didn't seem extremely busy but I remember having to flag down a bartender after a few minutes of not being greeted or offered a drink or app.

After about an hour, our table was ready and we were led to our outdoor table.  Once seated we had difficulty flagging down a waitress to place an order for more drinks and food.  The waitresses dress in plain clothes (no uniforms) so they blend in with all of the restaurant patrons.

We ordered a few food items.  Two orders of wings - the old bay and the buffalo; both sets were delicious! The big bag o fries for $12 - the bag is HUGE and totally worth the money; we had to take some home, there were so many.  Another friend got the chicken sandwich on a donut bun -- she said the chicken was nice n' crispy but could've been more heavily seasoned.

A band was setup to play outside - they performed from about 7:30 - 9.  A nice three piece band that played top 40's and some well known throwbacks.  Definitely added to the nice vibes of the place.

Overall, a fun visit and I'd definitely go back.  Be sure to sit outside when the weather is nice - their outdoor space is a big draw.  Drinks are solid (especially during happy hour when rails are $5).  Food is good - make sure to try the wings.   Would be a 5 star rating if service was a bit faster, but the slowness earns them a star deduction.",5,Yelp,P,R100000
V000000058,Bryana M.,6/28/21,"Yesterday when I went here I started a tab at the bar. We wanted to move sections so we close out at the bar. That first reciept had an error on it, and it was rectified. After we move, we order some more. When I went to pay for the final tab, I received the wrong tab apparently but I still paid. We then left. Soon after we receive a call from the other ppl we were with that they couldn't leave because we were being accused of never paying our bill. So I return and say I definitely paid and then they realize a mistake was made. But demanded we pay AGAIN. Received ZERO compensation, no refund for the initial incorrect bill I paid, and the bartender was telling me to be quiet, get over it, and calling me a theif. I really feel like I wouldn't have been treated so poorly if I was Caucasian. We paid two bills and went about our way. I will never return here.

The music selection was bearable lol and the waiter was attentive to our requests. I tried the Fried Chicken Sandwich with two baked donuts as buns. I have tried ""Luther"" donut sandwiches before at other establishments with bacon, chicken, and glazed donuts. My mind is saturated with so many tasty memories. This variation had slaw and a sauce inside. The chicken was moist and the flavors were well balanced. The sandwich would have been five stars with a bigger donut bun. The proportion of the sandwich in my opinion was a generous amount of chicken in between a ration size donut bun. To the donuts credit it was savory and just enough sweetness like a funnel cake without the instant nap lol The fries were also good. As far as still water goes it was average. The electric charging station and restaurant premises were well maintained. There is indoor and outdoor dining. I must be getting old, because I found the outside benches uncomfortable after an extended period of time (2hrs). Someone in my party picked the seat so I digress. There are tables with chairs as well outside lol. If you are in the area and looking to add a little peace to your day, Treat yourself to this College Park hangout spot.",4,Yelp,P,R100000

The location is definitely great to meet up with a few friends to catch a game or just hang out. The staff during each visit have been friendly. I appreciate the free parking in front of the building (the meters can catch you off guard if you're unfamiliar with the CP area). The dining areas are clean and nicely spaced out. It's nice to have the option to dine indoors at the bar, on the other side with the projector screen or outdoors. The stage outside is a nice touch where apparently events and a variety of performers come out.

I'm not sure if the menu is seasonal or not but the cocktails being offered this spring/summer have been refreshing and true to their name. The frosé was tasty. The crushes are a bit too sweet for my taste but they're ok if you like the ingredients. The Fire Melon Frozen Crush is an interesting combo of sweet and heat - my friend wasn't really a fan a would've preferred more of the watermelon flavor to stand out.

Food - The liquid feta takes the brussel sprouts to a new level - they're good. I've tasted the shrimp nachos and they are pretty good. The cheese is creamy and the nachos are crisp. It's nice that they don't skimp on the shrimp. The fried chicken sandwich (donut bun) was interesting, but it was decent. The donut isn't super sweet and the chicken has a good crisp but could use some heat. The fries are good.

I also ordered the Fried Buffalo Chicken Birria Tacos, which for $15 included three miniture tacos that were barely filled and a pile of rice and beans. The entire menu seems built to minimize the amount of food they give you. The small amount of food I received was tasty, but worth nowhere close to the $24 price tag.

It was raining, and the hostesses were not friendly at all and tried to make us leave the restaurant and forfeit our reservation because they apparently shut down the entire outdoor area after it rains because they don't want to dry the tables. We asked several times if they could accommodate us elsewhere because we did have a reservation from 5 days prior, and they kept offering new reasons as to why they couldn't seat us - ""we can't push 2 tables and umbrellas together"" ""it's wet and we typically don't dry the tables"" ""we're fully booked for 4 hours indoors and cannot even put you on a waiting list"". After over 10 minutes of back and forth, the hostess finally said ""oh well if you want you can sit at the community bar table"". I don't understand why this option was not presented to us in the beginning, as it was essentially a normal table inside that could accommodate us and was socially distanced. We also didn't appreciate that they repeatedly tried to rudely make us leave the restaurant rather than work with us to accommodate our reservation - it was like they couldn't care less about receiving our money and helping make a planned birthday brunch happen.",2,Yelp,N,R100000

Since then, I've been to The Hall a few times and have enjoyed the experience. Last night, however, was a big disappointment. I would consider myself to be a fairly regular customer of this establishment, and so when the waitress took my order, I didn't have to look at the menu. Little did I know that the menu changed. I had been at The Hall just a few days prior, so it's disappointing that I was not notified of this change. I split the nachos as an appetizer and the burger as an entree with my girlfriend. The shrimp in the nachos were burnt and absurdly garlicky. I checked the menu after and noticed that they didn't come with the beans or avocado that they were supposed to either. It was also frustrating that the appetizer that we ordered as, well, an appetizer, came out with our entree. This resulted in the food getting cold very quickly, and with nachos, they get soggy as well. The burger was good as always and we enjoyed the drinks, but the service at The Hall continues to be a disappointment.

Northwest Chinese serves a wide array of noodles, and soups mixed with a cornucopia of vegetable and meat options. My only complaint, is the entrée I ordered at a pepper icon next to it. I was expecting it to be spicy, and it really wasn't even midley spicy. That being said, I still loved the dish. One of the best food options in CP hands down.'",5,Google,P,R100001

My favorite aspect of the restaurant is how simple the menu is -- Qu does not try to do too much, they give you either ramen or hibachi, cooked to perfection.

V000000089,Ronak Patel,9/16/21,This place is definitely worth trying out. Dining in is an experience in and of itself because the ramen bowls are very nicely made (and look beautiful!). The employees also work very hard she would rush to clean up a table as soon as it is done being used and rush back if there was a customer waiting. The food took a bit longer than I thought but that’s either because they were busy or just because it’s prepared properly so it’s excusable.,5,Google,P,R100002
V000000090,Rizzy Rozay,10/16/21,Quick fix for Ramen lunch. Delivery friendly packaging. Tonkotsu is preferred over teriyaki chicken. Seasoned eggs are usually soft and jammy.

The portions are pretty big and I think it's budget friendly based on that size. I will say the Caesar dressing is pretty salty but it's my fault for asking for it heavy without tasting it first.

Mmmmm mmm good! 

I love the Covid measures and ordering online and literally my bag was waiting for me at the front door promptly at the time I chose to ready. On the other hand no one was there overseeing the hand offs so literally anyone could open the door and snatch a couple bags and been on their merry way...

(I waited 10 minutes to be ringed up at the cashier while the non line staff were just on their phones). Overrall the attitude of the staff made me feel extremely unwelcome and that they did not care and only wanted us to leave as soon as possible.
My two friends ended up receiving free soda drink cups as courtesy for running out of most of the available toppings.
I still had to pay for mine when they dropped my food and ended up spending almost a hour to finally get my food during empty service. If they werent going to give me a apology they couldve atleast given a small compensation.",1,Yelp,N,R100010

Their food is delicious! I can't claim to be vegan because there are rare days when I crave seafood and willfully give in. :-) But my diet is 90% plant-based. Nuvegan is my go-to spot when I don't feel like cooking. Literally everything is good.

My favorite dishes are the garlic kale, chik'n drummies, and of course the mac and cheese. Also noteworthy are the vegan crab cakes and vegan fried fish. Served cafeteria style so you view the dishes first hand before ordering. For our friends who love meat they serve plant based burgers, cheesesteak, and other filling options. They also offer desserts such as cheesecake, red velvet and cinnamon rolls. This location has a parking lot in the back with free parking. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. It's definitely worth dining even if you aren't about the plant-based life! You'll enjoy it.

Cons: I just wasn't impressed, everything was okay.

From the crunch to even the texture. The Buffalo sauce was good but it could eaten alone and still taste like chicken.
My hands down favorite was the garlic kale salad. Truly amazing!!! I could see myself adding some avocado to this for a side or meal with fish or something on top.  This salad was great. You do not taste the bitter kale.

When these folks first opened  the first restaurant on Georgia Avenue I used to go to that one and then I started coming to the one in College Park however if you ever ask any one of them what any of the food is made out of most of them will respond ""I don't know "" or ""it's made out of something maybe it's made out of soy proteins "" or something like that! Also I was ordering an average of $200 to $300 worth of food here every week but if you ask them something as simple as can you separate those greens or something of that magnitude so that the juice from the greens won't drip all over your food they try to charge you for an a la carte container. This happened to me today and I was going to order $75 worth of food and for a container that cost a penny or less the server was unprofessional. I just walked out! And she responded by saying "" OK BYE""  this little girl probably was in preschool when I started coming to the Georgia Avenue location and she just dismissed one of their loyal customers just like that!The server didn't seem to care so neither did I. I will order from another Vegan restaurant from now on However this is what I constantly tell people when they say that black people don't support black businesses it is because the service is usually terrible. It didn't start out like this but this is where they are now!Again the food is good but the servers don't usually do a lot in the way of helping the customers. I will be taking my thousand dollars a month someplace else. Maybe if they start to lose more loyal customers like me maybe about 10 of them and they start feeling a little bit lighter in the pockets then the owner of the restaurant will address their service issues and how it is important to help the customers not just people like me who have been coming in here  for years but just help them just because they are your customer! I guess the owner needs to tell his employees that there are no shortage of restaurants however in the age of Covid 19 there is a shortage of customers! Goodluck!",1,Yelp,N,R100009

Seasoned well, and not too spicy--just right.  I ordered the white sauce on the side, and they actually listened and put it in a small container. Little things like this matter, bc I can't tell you how many times the restaurant did not listen and sent me soggy food drowned in sauce. Both of the entrees were delicious.

I hate to write this review because the food is so good, but I can't order from here until the pandemic is over. 

The first time I picked up from them about a month ago, the person at the checkout area was not wearing a mask. I didn't say anything - I wasn't happy but figured it could be a one-off error. Today, we ordered from here again. At pickup, not only was the person from the checkout not wearing a mask, but no one I could see in the kitchen was wearing one either.

This county has an indoor mask mandate. My children have to wear masks in elementary school because adults won't do the right thing. 

I hope they use this post to re-evaluate their choices. I also don't love that anyone preparing my food was likely not wearing a mask. Will definitely have to pause this place unless I see some publicity that they are changing to always follow the mask mandate.",1,Yelp,N,R100004

The chicken was cooked nice and the falafel had a great taste. See the picture for the sauce combinations. Everything was super tasty and for a price of $13. It will definitely come for two meals. Khati Roll (5/5) The roll was soft and the meat was cooked perfectly with a kick of spice to it. 3. Mango lassi (4/5) it was good but I have had it better. We got a extra side with our order but they ran out of it and I asked to substitute for lassi and offered to pay the difference but the owner said it's on the house.

Similarly, the spicy chicken Kati roll is always and the qeema one is too ( but it's a bit on the oily side so it's prob best in a rice bowl ). Mango Lassi is nice but i personally prefer my lassi with more yogurt in it as it makes a thicker drink.",5,Yelp,P,R100004
V000000148,Ifeoma I.,1/22/20,"Krazi Kebob is located at College Park, pretty much within the Maryland campus. I finally visited and got the Krazi Kati roll, which was not only very richly flavored, but was also quite filling. For people that appreciate hotness to their meals, this had a kick to it and was not too overwhelming with the spice. 

The interior is a little cozy, there is some space that can fit a small group, and multiple 2 people and individual bar style seating areas. The staff was very very polite and ensured that we were attended to and satisfied with out orders. 

Stop by for a quick lunch break, or sit in and enjoy the meal with amazing service.",4,Yelp,P,R100004

The table was a little wobbly (we fixed it ;)), the poor waitress seemed a little overburdened, but definitely good for the price.And then, this plus a charming two player board game!

The game selection is incredible, the service was fantastic, the food and drinks were delicious. My boyfriend is vegan and we struggle to find many vegan options where we live (in Alabama) but The Board and Brew had several very tasty vegan options. If you're in town, definitely check them out!

It's obvious he cares about your experience and providing the best service possible.

board games on shelves, and large windows. I also had a wonderful server who took care me and my company.

Despite the great ambiance, I felt that the meal was a little disappointing. I tried the Korean pulled pork sandwich with fries and a lavender lemon mint iced tea. The tea lacked lavender flavor and tasted too strongly of mint. The Korean pulled pork sandwich itself was a bit salty but the fries were spectacular.

I'll admit, the price was respectable for the generous serving size but the meal didn't live to expectations.",3,Yelp,N,R100005

I've never played the games myself, but I've seen tons of couples, families, and friends having a fabulous time! The awesome staff have an encyclopedic knowledge of board games, and I've often seen them helping folks pick out a perfect game and settle their in-game disputes.

- Clean warehouse like aesthetic, which I'm a sucker for.

V000000221,Rick W.,8/1/21,"I could talk about having lived through the corporate monocultural decimation of independent coffee shops in the early 90's but that would be negative.  Instead I will just say that Vigilante Coffee is amazing... strong, not burnt, beautiful... as if I went back in time and reset the coffee-clock back to delicious.  Please, when you travel, look for the independents.",5,Yelp,P,R100009
V000000222,Yasi H.,7/14/21,"Vigilante is hands down my favorite coffee spot in the surrounding College Park/UMD area. They have two locations, one near campus itself and one about 10 minutes down the road in Hyattsville.

I used to study and chill at both locations as a student and try to visit often, as my sister goes here now.

They have a really efficient to-go ordering system where you can simply order online and pick it up. It is always ready super fast.",5,Yelp,P,R100009

V000000224,Megan M.,6/16/21,"Love this place to death but for some reason when I visited on 6/16/21 the lid didn't fit on my large cold brew and dripped all over the floor of the elevator of my apartment complex. Really lucky it didn't somehow get all over my brand new lululemon top or I'd be really upset but had I been in the car or in traffic and that happened... could've easily caused an accident. I've never had this happen before so I'm not holding it against them but just a fair warning in case it might happen to anyone else! Their prices are fair. Wish their açaí bowls were a little bigger but they are the right kind of açaí, dark purple, not that surgery crap. Great place. Really is.",5,Yelp,P,R100009

V000000227,Melissa H.,4/8/21,"Stopped by Vigilante on our DC trip and I was impressed. They take appropriate measures against COVID and ensure their customers follow the guidelines.

- Hot chocolate 5/5: I got the medium size which is perfect for me. The chocolate and milk ratio was perfect, and so was the sweetness.
- Matcha latte 4/5: I got the large size which was too much for me haha. This wasn't too sweet but I was hoping that the matcha would be slightly stronger.
- Chocolate croissant 5/5: had it warmed and it was amazing! Super flaky, slightly moist with the perfect amount of chocolate chunks",5,Google,P,R100009
V000000228,John K.,4/6/21,I know this review will make me sound like I am a coffee noob when I tell you the following: the iced latte (w/oat milk) here is I reckon the most memorable I've had. Goodness does it hit.,5,Google,P,R100009

V000000230,Austin G,2/19/21,"Right in front of a tall apartment building is the second location of Hyattsville-based coffee roastery Vigilante Coffee. Engulfed by apartment and commercial buildings, this location is in a long white brick building with a fun pink dinosaur mural on its side.

Since I went in the middle of the pandemic, I only got a glimpse of the inside as I picked up my maple latte. It looked spacious and well designed, a peaceful place to work/study post-pandemic.

Their order system is easy. Go to their website and follow the steps. Within minutes, your order is ready and handed to you by a friendly staff member.

The coffee itself is really good and they have many sugar and milk options including monkfruit.",5,Google,P,R100009
V000000231,Anthony S.,2/3/21,"This review is only on the bean sales, not the service of making coffee. There are two things that really annoy me about this place. First, the quantity in the bags. My most recent bag (which is the reason I am writing this review), had 303 grams of coffee instead of the 340 grams. Now, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the next time I bought a bag I got 380 grams. However, I have noticed that their bags are always shy of the advertised amount (I've weighed these on three different scales and all have the same measurement - I would urge Vigilante to double check their instruments!). Usually, I am 5-10 grams shy of the 340 gram amount. No big deal. But 37 grams short is about 10% (1.8$ of coffee on this most recent trip). This annoys me because I am not getting the advertised amount but also because it means that I don't have enough coffee for my week!",3,Google,N,R100009
V000000232,Kate B.,1/23/21,"Great coffee. It is nice to have a local roaster to support. While the service is not fast that's because they really seem to care, about health and safety as well as getting the orders done right.",5,Google,P,R100009
V000000233,Kara Y.,1/16/21,"Perfect jolt of coffee goodness to kick off the new year! I am so jealous that CP students have this so close to campus - where was Vigilante when we needed it 10+ years ago...??!

Due to COVID, their ordering process is online for curbside pick up. Make sure to check out their website before you stop by! My SO and I both enjoyed our maple spice lattes and I have to say, I really loved my version with oat milk (versus whole milk). The biscoff cookie took it over the top!

Highlight also had to be the pastry that we ordered (made by Souk) - the honey pistachio kougin amann was absolutely divine. The kougin amann was flaky, buttery, and the right amount of sweetness.

If we're ever nearby again, I definitely plan on trying more of their coffee/tea/food offerings!",4,Google,P,R100009

V000000235,Fushcia H.,12/29/20,"I stopped by here after getting lunch at NuVegan Cafe while on campus for the day. This was my first time here and wow, a very small place and very busy. I went last fall so it was packed and there were no spaces to sit. My friend and I decided to get coffees to go. It's was not my favorite coffee, I think it might have been a light roast because they seem to have less flavor but be more bitter at times. I'm not sure but I wasn't a fan. I think I'll try their teas next time I go and hopefully I'll find something I like!",3,Google,N,R100009

V000000237,Danielle L.,10/31/21,"I placed on online order for 1 chicken salad sandwich at 1:52 PM, thats it, no chips, cookie, soup or nothing. JUST 1 SINGLE CHICKEN SALAD sandwich. My receipt said it would be ready at 2:01PM. I literally got there at 2:02 and it wasn't ready so I waited another 5 min and finally asked the older lady at the cash register about my order. She and a guy looked through a pile of receipts and said its coming up. Another 20min passes and I ask the guy about my sandwich. He said ""its coming or you can just cancel it"" rudely. After I've been waiting over 20 min.. So I said, yeah go ahead and cancel but I want a receipt showing it was canceled since I already paid online"". He now has attitude and says ""I have to call it in later, there's nothing I can give you to show it was canceled"". So why would I leave without any documentation showing it was canceled and no sandwich? Now Im irritated so I said, lets just make the sandwich. I could only imagine leaving without anything then dealing with a dispute about a refund. So I'm still standing there, I watched several other people who came after me leave with their food. I am standing near the pickup shelf and the old lady from the register walks by me and made a rude comment about me standing there ""being all in the way"" I didn't get my sandwich until around 2:40 PM! I did not even get an apology or anything. I hate this location and they need new staff with better attitudes!! Top it off the sandwich was NASTY!

They say it is because they have to call a door dash driver to pick it and told me it is easier to just use door dash at the beginning. The problem with that is you can’t use the reward points and the prices for the sandwich goes up.
